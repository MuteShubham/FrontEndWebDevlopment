          Depending on <a href="">Mobile Frameworks</a> how you obtained the
          Windows software, this is a license agreement between (i) you and the
          device manufacturer or software installer that distributes the
          software with your device; or (ii) you and Microsoft Corporation (or,
          based on where you live or, if a business, where your principal place
          of business is located, one of its affiliates) if you acquired the
          software from a retailer. Microsoft is the device manufacturer for
          devices produced by Microsoft or one of its affiliates, and Microsoft
          is the retailer if you acquired the software directly from Microsoft.
          Note that if you are a volume license customer, use of this software
          is subject to your volume license agreement rather than this
          agreement.
